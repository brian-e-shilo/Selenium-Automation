**Introduction to Selenium Automation with Maven in Eclipse**

Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browser interactions, enabling automated testing of web applications to ensure their functionality and performance. By using Selenium, you can simulate user actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating web pages, across various browsers.

Maven, on the other hand, is a powerful build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects. It simplifies project setup and management by handling libraries and plugins required for building, testing, and deploying applications.

When combined with Eclipse, a widely used integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development, these tools provide a comprehensive setup for automated testing:

- **Eclipse**: Offers a user-friendly interface and powerful tools for writing and managing code.
- **Maven**: Manages project dependencies and simplifies the build process.
- **Selenium**: Automates browser actions to test web applications effectively.

In this setup:

- **Maven** handles dependencies like Selenium WebDriver, JUnit/TestNG for testing, and other libraries.
- **Eclipse** is used for developing test scripts, running tests, and debugging.
- **Selenium WebDriver** interacts with web browsers to perform the automated tests.

This combination allows developers and testers to efficiently automate and manage testing processes, ensuring that web applications work as intended across different browsers and environments.

I have attached the complete pdf, which is also the same file that I had submitted as an assignment for my college earlier this year. It illustrates everything in detail.

Hope you find it helpful!
